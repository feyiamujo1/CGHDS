        <h2>CGHDS International Consortium</h2>
        <p>
          The CGHDS International Consortium is an inclusive platform dedicated
          to advancing gender, humanitarian, and development studies on a global
          scale. Within this consortium, we offer various avenues for knowledge
          exchange and collaboration:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>CGHDS International Conferences</li>
          <li>CGHDS’ Lecture Series</li>
          <li>CGHDS Webinar</li>
          <li>CGHDS Non-Degree Certificate Courses</li>
          <li>CGHDS Exhibitions</li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          Promoting gender and humanitarian values is one of the core work areas
          of CGHDS. Hence, the CGHDS International Consortium through its
          International Conferences, Webinar and Lecture Series aims to bring
          awareness of pressing global challenges on gender, humanitarian and
          development issues to the concerned public and civil society in
          Nigeria, with a focus on how each individual can contribute to
          resolving such challenges. It also offers an intellectual anchor for
          the work of Government MDAs and CSOs on gender, humanitarian and
          development concerns and as well as a mechanism to channel current
          thinking and research into policy-making.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Consortium is unique in that, although its three major programmes
          (International conferences, Webinar and the Lecture Series) will be
          organized and hosted by the Centre for Gender, Humanitarian and
          Development Studies (CGHDS), Redeemer’s University, Ede, Nigeria, they
          will be open not only to the academic Communities but also to
          diplomatic communities and anyone interested in and concerned with the
          topics discussed. The audience has an opportunity to raise questions
          and engage in discussions with authoritative speakers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The International Conferences will be hosted once in three years while
          the Webinar and Lecture Series will be held biannually, that is twice
          a year. The Consortium was conceived to promote public interest and
          understanding of gender and humanitarian activities, locally and
          abroad. The lectures are co-developed by CGHDS and its partners (as
          part of our enduring efforts in humanitarian diplomacy. The Grand
          Patron of the Consortium is Mr Benedict Alabi, former Deputy Governor
          of Osun State, Nigeria.

              Disaster resilience in response to catastrophic weather events and
              other natural and man-made disasters requires international
              cooperation in the form of Official Development Aid (ODA) as well
              as capacity building.
